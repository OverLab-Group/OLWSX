# OverLab Web ServerX – The first actor-based, 3LS, Hybrid-Executioner, and AI-Driven web server worldwide 🌍⚔️

## 👁️ What is OLWSX?
Meet **OLWSX** – not just a web server, but a living beast of the internet.  
It’s the **first actor-based**, **modular**, **enterprise-grade** web server with **3-Layered Security (3LS)**, designed to be **developer-friendly** and **fully extensible**.  

But OLWSX doesn’t stop there:  
- ⚡ It’s the world’s first **Hybrid-Executioner**, automatically juggling workloads across **CPU 🧠, GPU 🎮, RAM ⚡, and storage 💾 (NVMe, SSD, and even HDD in desperate times)**.  
- 🛡️ Even if the server owner tries to launch a massive DDoS against it, OLWSX just yawns and keeps running.  
- 🤖 Powered by **autonomous AI**, OLWSX decides who’s a legit user 👩‍💻, who’s a scraper 🕷️, and who’s an attacker 🐍.  

This isn’t just software. It’s a **hungry guardian beast** that feeds on hackers and scrapers, while protecting real users like royalty 👑.

## 🎉 Ready to dive in?
**OLWSX** is a legendary web server built for high-traffic apps.  
It’s made for everyone — **not only enterprises**, but also indie devs, startups, and even beginners.  

It comes with its own config file (`.wsx`) and DSL 🍔, while still integrating with Apache (`.htaccess`), Nginx (`.conf`), and LiteSpeed (`.conf`).  
But beware:  
👉 **Without `.wsx`, you’re just running a boring server. With `.wsx`, you’re commanding a legend.** ⚔️🔥
